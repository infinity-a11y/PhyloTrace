PhyloTrace is a platform for bacterial pathogen monitoring on a genomic level. Its components evolve around Core-Genome Multilocus Sequence Typing (cgMLST) and Antimicrobial Resistance Screening. Complex analyses and computation are wrapped into an appealing and easy-to-handle graphical user interface. Users build a local database comprising analyzed isolates, manageable directly with the application. The visualization of isolate relationship and genetic profile is highly interactive aiding to reveal patterns explaining outbreak dynamics and events by connecting genomic information with epidemiologic variables. PhyloTrace achieves universal compatibility by assigning unique 256-bit hashes based on sequence and allele information. The ability to easily share analysis results enables efficient inter-lab comparison and collaboration.

## 1 Getting Started

PhyloTrace is an open-source platform for *in silico* bacterial typing with core-genome multilocus
sequence typing (cgMLST). This method allows pathogen monitoring on a genomic level by typing allele
variants in order to profile the present genetic constitution for individual isolates of a bacterial
population. Comparing the allelic profile to other isolates of the same species might reveal
coherences that are not visible by the bare eye. Visualizing the generated data enables humans to
identify patterns of epidemiologic dynamics (transmission, outbreak variants, source
identification), relatedness and population structure. To work with PhyloTrace all that is needed
are whole-genome assemblies which demarcate the starting point of the workflow. Easily pipe the
files into the cgMLST analysis and step-by-step build up a local database, which can be managed with
full control through the app. Visualize and export results in a publication-ready format.

## 1.1 Workflow

The **user manual** containing detailed instruction and information is available at
[www.phylotrace.com/user-manual](https://www.phylotrace.com/user-manual).

<details open>

<summary><b>Manage cgMLST Scheme</b></summary>

<br>

Download a standardized scheme that defines the genetic targets, nomenclature and allele sequences
for the bacterial species of interest from the [cgMLST.org](https://www.cgmlst.org/ncs) and [PubMLST](https://pubmlst.org/) public databases. The connection to the server including information on the scheme is integrated in the app. Once one of the 69 available species has been selected and downloaded, everything is ready to go. The scheme can be inspected in detail using the locus info interface.

</div>

<br>

</details>

<details>

<summary><b>Allelic Typing</b></summary>

<br>

Whole-genome assemblies can be entered into the pipeline and are automatically analyzed
at high speed. Using the downloaded cgMLST scheme, the bacterial genome is aligned to the known
variants at the respective genetic target. By iterating this process over all genes that are part of
the core genome, an individual allele profile is generated. If a potential new genetic variant is
discovered, it is checked whether the existing allele is still capable of producing a functional
protein. Successfully typed assemblies are appended to the local database in real time.

<img src="docs/resources/typing_results.png" width="48%"/>
</div>

<br>

</details>

<details>

<summary><b>Building and Managing Database</b></summary>

<br>

Step-by-step the database is filled with typed isolates and the connected metadata. The database
browser provides full control allowing to edit, delete and inspect the entries that were added so
far. It features several functions, e.g. to export the table, compare allelic profiles or to
introduce custom variables with information about presence/absence of antimicrobial resistances,
gene expression values or any other characteristic, to answer individual research questions.

</div>

<br>

</details>

<details>

<summary><b>Visualizing Typing Results</b></summary>

<br>

Create and customize sophisticated hierarchic trees (Neighbour-Joining & UPGMA) or networks
(Minimum-spanning) to visualize the underlying relationship between the isolates in your local
database. The plots can be heavily modified and enriched with useful information e.g. by mapping
previously added custom variables. The resulting visuals can be saved in multiple formats and even
included in a report document that can be generated from within the app.

<br>

</details>

<details>

<summary><b>Antimicrobial Resistance Screening</b></summary>

<br>

Screen isolates in seconds for known resistance, virulence and stress genes using an interface 
that wraps around the proven AMRFinder tool. Visualize the presence or absence of these markers 
along with user-defined variables among isolates in a fully interactive heatmap.

```

After this, follow the instructions below.

</details>

### 2.1 Download Source Code

Donwload the source code of the latest stable version. 

Use the terminal to navigate to an accessible location on your system and clone the repository using Git.

```
git clone https://github.com/infinity-a11y/PhyloTrace.git
```

Alternatively download PhyloTrace manually from [Version 1.6.1](https://github.com/infinity-a11y/PhyloTrace/archive/refs/tags/v1.6.1.zip) and extract/unzip it to a location on your system.


### 2.2 Install Miniconda

Is ***Miniconda*** or another ***Conda Distribution*** installed on the system?  

**No**  :arrow_right: Run the installation below and initialize conda  <br>
 
**Yes** :arrow_right: Proceed to [2.3 Install PhyloTrace](#23-install-phylotrace)

These four commands quickly and quietly install the latest 64-bit version of Miniconda and then
clean up after themselves. 

> _For installation of Miniconda on system with different architecture, please refer to the [Miniconda documentation](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/index.html)._

``` bash
mkdir -p ~/miniconda3
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
bash ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh -b -u -p ~/miniconda3
rm ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
```

After installation, the newly-installed Miniconda should be initialized with the following command:

``` bash
~/miniconda3/bin/conda init
```

To start using conda, the terminal should be restarted.

> ***Optional:*** *To disable automatic activation of conda whenever the terminal is started, the
> following command can be executed:*

``` bash
conda config --set auto_activate_base false
```

### 2.3 Install PhyloTrace

Run install script to generate a run script and include PhyloTrace desktop icon in the Applications
Menu.

``` bash
cd path/to/phylotrace/directory
bash install_phylotrace.sh
```

> *In the command above, replace `path/to/phylotrace/directory` with the actual path linking to the PhyloTrace
> directory on your system.*

### 2.4 Uninstall

To uninstall PhyloTrace from your system, remove the application directory and run the following
command to remove the desktop launcher and the PhyloTrace conda environment:

``` bash
rm -r $HOME/.local/share/phylotrace
rm $HOME/.local/share/applications/PhyloTrace.desktop
rm $HOME/.local/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/PhyloTrace.png
conda remove -n PhyloTrace --all -y
```

### 2.5 Troubleshooting

There are multiple possible sources for issues with the installation. Common mistakes during the
installation are: 
- Change `path/to/phylotrace/directory` in the command chunks with the actual path of the repository containing all PhyloTrace files
- Before installation make sure the whole repository is unzipped to a writable location in your system

If the installation issues persist feel free to contact us via
[info\@phylotrace.com](mailto:info@phylotrace.com?subject=%5BGitHub%5D%20Source%20Han%20Sans) or
open an issue.

#### Desktop Launcher not Working

If the desktop launcher is not working, the currently set default browser is likely not declared
properly. To resolve this, change the R_BROWSER environment variable to the executable name of the
desired browser (executable names for popular browsers are listed in the table below). For example
to use Google Chrome, execute the following command:

``` bash
cd path/to/phylotrace/directory
R_BROWSER=google-chrome
bash run_phylotrace.sh
```

> *In the command above, replace `path/to/phylotrace/directory` with the actual path linking to the PhyloTrace
> directory on your system.*

| Browser       | *browser-name*                                |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Google Chrome | *google-chrome* **or** *google-chrome-stable* |
| Chromium      | *chromium*                                    |
| Brave         | *brave-browser*                               |
| Opera         | *opera*                                       |
